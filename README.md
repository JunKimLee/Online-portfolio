# Online-portfolio
Created a website about me and skills I bring to the workforce.
Working with Tailwind, React/React-icons, also worked with getForm.io to get forms down on the contact list

How to run:
1. Open VScode 
2. Download my whole file as zip 
3. In terminal "npm start" to generate a local host
4. Once succesfully opened check out the content


#side note - Still trying to figure out what projects to display on my online portfolio. Deploying my portfolio online once everything is set up.
